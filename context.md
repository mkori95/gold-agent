## 🎯 What We Are Building

A **WhatsApp-first precious metals and gems advisor for Indian families** — specifically targeting Indian housewives and everyday gold buyers who currently have no simple, trustworthy, vernacular source of gold price information and buying advice.

### The One Line Product Vision
> "A personal gold buying advisor that lives in WhatsApp — tells you the right time to buy gold, silver and platinum — in your language, for your city, before every festival."

### Why This Exists
- Indian housewives check gold prices by calling their jeweller (conflict of interest) or asking their husband
- No app or service serves this audience in Hindi, Tamil or Telugu
- WhatsApp is already on every phone — no download needed
- General AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) cannot do proactive alerts, persistent memory, or city-specific Indian rates reliably
- The India-specific angle (IBJA rates, city-wise INR, MCX, festival calendar) is our strongest differentiator

---

## 📦 Metals and Gems Covered

- **Gold** — USD spot + INR city rates (22K, 24K)
- **Silver** — USD spot + INR rates
- **Platinum** — USD spot + INR rates
- **Copper** — USD spot (festival context — vessels, idols)
- **Diamond** — Skipped for now. Rapaport is paywalled. Will revisit in Phase 2.

---

## 🌍 Languages Supported at Launch

- Hindi
- Tamil
- Telugu

Language is auto-detected from user's message. User never has to select.

---

## 💰 Commercial Model

Keeping free for now. Future phases:
- Jeweller partnership program (Priority 1 rate display)
- Digital gold referrals (SafeGold, Augmont)
- Premium subscription
- API access for businesses

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Deployment
- Fully serverless on AWS
- No EC2 — everything is Lambda
- GitHub repository (open source, monorepo)

### Primary Product

## 📊 Data Sources — FINAL ACTIVE LIST

> ⚠️ These are the ONLY active sources. yahoo_finance.py, ibja.py, kitco.py, moneycontrol.py, rapaport.py were removed or skipped.

### Active Sources (in build order)
| # | Source ID | File | Metals | Limit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | gold_api_com | gold_api_com.py | Gold, Silver, Platinum, Copper | Unlimited | ✅ Built & tested |
| 2 | metals_dev | metals_dev.py | Gold, Silver, Platinum, Copper | 100/month | ✅ Built & tested |
| 3 | goldapi_io | goldapi_io.py | Gold, Silver, Platinum | 100/month | ✅ Built & tested |
| 4 | free_gold_api | free_gold_api.py | Gold (historical) | Unlimited | ❌ Disabled permanently |
| 5 | goodreturns | goodreturns.py | Gold (city-wise INR) | Unlimited | ✅ Built & tested |
| 6 | moneycontrol | — | MCX backup | Unlimited | ⏭️ Skipped — MCX already in Metals.Dev |
| 7 | rapaport | — | Diamond index | Unlimited | ⏭️ Skipped — paywalled |

### Why Sources Were Skipped
- **moneycontrol** — MCX gold/silver data is already captured in `metals_dev.py` extra{} fields. Duplicate data, scraping risk not worth it.
- **rapaport** — Actual price list is behind a paid subscription. No public HTML to scrape. Diamond data deferred to Phase 2.
- **free_gold_api** — Returns full dataset from 1258 AD — no date filtering supported. Disabled permanently.

### Current Metal Coverage
| Metal | Sources |
|---|---|
| Gold | gold_api_com ✅ metals_dev ✅ goldapi_io ✅ goodreturns ✅ |
| Silver | gold_api_com ✅ metals_dev ✅ goldapi_io ✅ |
| Platinum | gold_api_com ✅ metals_dev ✅ goldapi_io ✅ |
| Copper | gold_api_com ✅ metals_dev ✅ |
| Diamond | ❌ skipped for now |

### Phase 4 Paid Sources (future — not building yet)
| Source | Cost | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Metals-API.com | $4.99/month | City-wise Indian prices — replaces GoodReturns scraper |
| IBJA Official API | Contact for pricing | RBI approved benchmark — most authoritative India source |

---

## ⚙️ Source Configuration System

Single `config/sources.json` file controls everything:
- `type` — api / scraper
- `priority` — 1 / 2 / 3
- `enabled` — true / false
- `health_status` — healthy / warning / disabled
- `rate_limit` — requests per month + strategy
- `schedule` — frequency in minutes + active hours + timezone
- `failure_handling` — retry count + auto recovery + fallback source
- `metals` — which metals this source covers
- `fields_map` — maps our standard field names to API-specific field names

### Adding New Sources
Edit sources.json only — no code changes needed.

---

## 🧠 ALL BUSINESS LOGIC — FINALISED DECISIONS

### 1. Data Collection Logic

- Every source runs **independently on its own schedule** — they don't wait for each other
- **Collect from ALL sources always** — priority does not mean skipping lower priority sources
- **Sources run in parallel** — not sequentially — makes the pipeline faster
- One source failing never affects any other source

---

### 2. Circuit Breaker Logic

```
Failure 1  →  Log warning, retry in 15 minutes
Failure 2  →  Email alert to developer, retry in 15 minutes
Failure 3  →  Disable source completely — SNS + Email immediately
           →  Auto recovery attempt every 60 minutes
           →  If recovers → re-enable + notify ✅
           →  If still broken → stay disabled + notify again ❌
```

Stored in DynamoDB `source_health` table — `consecutive_failures` field increments on each failure.

---

### 3. Quota Management Logic

For rate-limited sources (GoldAPI.io, Metals.Dev — 100 calls/month):

```
Usage 0–79%    →  Run normally
Usage 80–94%   →  Send warning to developer
Usage 95–99%   →  Switch to fallback source defined in sources.json
Usage 100%     →  Disable for rest of month, fallback only
Day 1 of month →  Auto-reset quota counter
```

Stored in DynamoDB `quota_tracker` table.

---

### 4. Price Consensus Logic (Trimmed Mean)
 
**Step by step:**
```
Step 1  →  Collect all prices for a metal from all active sources
Step 2  →  Run anomaly detection — reject any price outside metals.json range
Step 3  →  Count VALIDATED sources only (sources that passed anomaly detection)
Step 4  →  Apply calculation based on validated source count
Step 5  →  Calculate spread across all validated prices
Step 6  →  Assign confidence level
Step 7  →  Store consensus + all raw source prices preserved
```
 
**Source count rules (based on VALIDATED sources, not total sources run):**
```
0 sources   →  No data — alert developer        →  confidence: "unavailable"
1 source    →  Use as-is, flag clearly           →  confidence: "low"
2 sources   →  Simple average                    →  confidence: "medium"
3+ sources  →  Drop highest + lowest, average rest  →  confidence: "high"
```
 
**Why 3+ uses same rule as 4+ (revised from Session 8):**
Previous logic used median for exactly 3 sources and trimmed mean for 4+.
Simplified to one consistent rule: always trim highest + lowest for 3+ sources.
For exactly 3 sources, trimming highest + lowest leaves 1 — same as median.
One rule is simpler to reason about, test, and maintain.
 
**Why validated source count matters (revised from Session 8):**
If 3 sources run but anomaly detection rejects one, you have 2 trusted prices.
Counting total sources run would give false "high" confidence with only "medium"
quality data. Always count sources that PASSED validation.
 
**Anomaly detection** — before including any price in the calculation:
- Check against `price_range_usd` in metals.json
- If price is outside range → reject that data point + log warning
- Example: gold at $500 or $50,000 → rejected immediately
- Other sources continue normally — one bad source never stops others
 
**Spread monitoring** — after calculating consensus:
```
spread_percent = (max - min) / consensus × 100
 
spread < 1%   →  Normal — log only
spread 1-2%   →  Log warning — sources diverging
spread > 2%   →  Log warning + flag in snapshot
```
 
**GoodReturns is NOT included in trimmed mean** — different unit (gram vs troy
ounce), different currency (INR vs USD), different price type (retail vs spot).
Feeds directly into `city_rates{}` on the snapshot only.
 
**INR conversion** — Metals.Dev only (single source of truth):
```
inr_rate = currencies.INR from Metals.Dev response
usd_to_inr = 1 / inr_rate
price_inr = price_usd / inr_rate
 
If Metals.Dev fails → price_inr = null across entire snapshot
Never guess the exchange rate
```
 
**Raw source prices always preserved:**
```json
"source_prices": {
    "gold_api_com": 3100.00,
    "metals_dev":   3098.00,
    "goldapi_io":   3106.50
}
```
 
---

### 5. INR Conversion Logic

```
Source provides INR directly (GoodReturns)  →  Use as-is — no conversion
Source provides USD only (all API sources)  →  Convert using exchange rate
Exchange rate source                        →  Metals.Dev only (single source of truth)
Exchange rate field                         →  currencies.INR from Metals.Dev response
Exchange rate formula                       →  usd_to_inr = 1 / currencies.INR
Exchange rate storage                       →  scraper.inr_rate on MetalsDevScraper
                                               → passed to DataNormaliser by consolidator
```

INR conversion happens in the **consolidator via DataNormaliser** — never in individual scrapers.
Exception: GoodReturns scraper returns `price_inr` directly because that's all it has.

### 7. Consolidator Testing Approach

- Written as a **standalone Python class** first — testable locally like all scrapers
- Thin Lambda wrapper added at the end (5 lines)
- No Docker, no SAM, no LocalStack needed for Phase 1
- Run locally: `python src/lambdas/consolidator/consolidator.py`

---

### 8. Jeweller Rate Priority Logic

The ONLY place where source priority affects what the user sees:

```
User asks about a specific jeweller
         ↓
Is there a verified PARTNER rate?     → Show it  ✅  Phase 4
         ↓ No
Is there a valid COMMUNITY rate?      → Show it with confidence level  ✅  Phase 3
         ↓ No
Fall back to MARKET rate + education  → Explain what to expect  ✅  Phase 2
```

---

### 9. Community Rate Validation Logic

A rate must pass ALL 6 guardrails — fail any one → rate not shown:

```
Guardrail 1  →  Minimum 3 unique phone numbers reported
Guardrail 2  →  Spread between all reports must be < 2%
Guardrail 3  →  Rate must be within ±5% of official market rate
Guardrail 4  →  All reports must be less than 24 hours old
Guardrail 5  →  Weight by reporter reputation score
Guardrail 6  →  One report per phone number per jeweller
```

Calculation: trimmed mean with reputation weights — same trimmed mean concept as price consensus.

---

### 10. Community Rate Confidence Logic

```
3+ reports AND spread < 0.5%   →  ⭐⭐⭐ High confidence — show to user
3–5 reports AND spread < 1%    →  ⭐⭐ Medium confidence — show to user
Anything else                  →  Don't show — fall back to market rate
```

---

### 11. User Reputation Logic

Every user who submits jeweller rates has a hidden score (0–100):

```
Starting score     →  50 (neutral — new, unknown reporter)
Accurate report    →  Score increases
Outlier report     →  Score decreases
Consistent reports →  Score grows over time
```

Accuracy measured by comparing reporter's submission to final community consensus after calculation.
Close to consensus = accurate. Far from consensus = outlier.

---

### 12. Alert Logic

```
User sets price threshold  →  e.g. "Tell me when gold hits ₹55,000"
Alert checker runs         →  Every hour via EventBridge
Threshold breached         →  Send WhatsApp message immediately
Cooldown                   →  4 hours before alerting same user again
                              (prevents spam if price fluctuates near threshold)
```

---

### 13. Festival Advisory Logic

```
EventBridge checks festival calendar  →  Daily
7 days before any festival            →  Trigger advisory Lambda
Advisory Lambda fetches               →  Current price + trend + historical context
Sends proactive WhatsApp to           →  All opted-in users in relevant region
Language                              →  User's saved preference (Hindi/Tamil/Telugu)
```

---

### 14. Language Detection Logic

```
First message from user     →  Auto-detect language
Save to DynamoDB            →  All future messages in same language
User can override           →  "Switch to Hindi" / "Hindi mein bolo"
Default if detection fails  →  English
```

---

### 15. WhatsApp 24-Hour Window Logic

```
User messages us            →  24-hour window opens
Within 24 hours             →  Reply freely in any format
After 24 hours of silence   →  Can only send pre-approved templates
Alert or digest needed      →  Check window first
  Window open               →  Send as regular message
  Window closed             →  Send as approved template
```

---

## 💬 WhatsApp — Meta Cloud API

### Key Rules
- First 1,000 user-initiated conversations/month → FREE
- 24-hour window rule — after 24hr silence, can only send approved templates
- 7 templates needed upfront — submitted once, approved in 24-48hrs
- Quality rating must stay GREEN — no spam, always add value
- Dedicated phone number needed (virtual number ok)
- Tier 1 = 1,000 unique users/day — grows automatically

### Templates Needed
1. welcome_message
2. price_alert
3. weekly_digest
4. festival_advisory
5. daily_morning_rate
6. price_drop_alert
7. price_rise_alert

---

## 🏪 Jeweller Rate System — 3 Solutions Combined

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.12 (Mac) |
| AI Brain | Anthropic Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-6) |
| Infrastructure | AWS SAM |
| Primary Channel | Meta WhatsApp Business Cloud API |
| Scraping | curl_cffi + BeautifulSoup |
| Frontend | React (Phase 4) |
| Package Manager | pip + venv |
| Version Control | GitHub (SSH keys) |
| Region | ap-south-1 (Mumbai) |

---

## 💻 Local Dev Setup

```bash
# Always activate venv first
source venv/bin/activate

# Always run scripts from project root
python src/lambdas/consolidator/consolidator.py

# Never run from inside src/ or tests/ folders
```

### Python Package Setup (already done — do not redo)
- `setup.py` exists at project root
- `pip install -e .` already run
- All `__init__.py` files exist in src/, src/scrapers/, src/scrapers/engine/, src/scrapers/sites/
- Import pattern: `from src.scrapers.engine.base_scraper import BaseScraper`
- File path pattern: always use relative paths from project root e.g. `open("config/sources.json")`

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

All API keys are in `.env` at project root. Every file loads this automatically.

```
METALS_DEV_API_KEY=...
GOLDAPI_IO_KEY=...
GOLD_API_COM_KEY=...    (not needed — no auth)
```

Phase 2+:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
WHATSAPP_TOKEN=...
WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID=...
GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY=...
```

---

## 📐 Code Patterns — Follow These in Every File

### 1. Every file starts with
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```
This is the FIRST import in every file. Non-negotiable.

### 2. Every scraper inherits from BaseScraper
```python
class MySourceScraper(BaseScraper):
    def __init__(self, source_config: dict):
        super().__init__(source_config)
        self.fetcher = APIFetcher(source_config)  # for API sources
        self.scraper = HTMLScraper(source_config) # for HTML scrapers

    def fetch(self) -> list:
        # implement this — return list of price records
```

### 3. Standard price record format (from build_price_record)
```json
{
    "metal": "gold",
    "price_usd": 5226.19,
    "currency": "USD",
    "price_inr": null,
    "unit": "troy_ounce",
    "source_id": "goldapi_io",
    "source_name": "GoldAPI.io",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-27T10:00:00Z",
    "extra": {}
}
```

### 4. price_inr is always null from API scrapers
INR conversion happens in consolidator via DataNormaliser — NOT in individual scrapers.
Exception: GoodReturns returns `price_inr` directly, `price_usd` = null.

### 5. One metal/city failure never stops others
Always wrap per-metal or per-city logic in try/except and continue on failure.

### 6. HTML scraper uses curl_cffi — not requests
`html_scraper.py` uses `from curl_cffi import requests` with `impersonate="chrome120"`.
Never revert to standard `requests` — Indian finance sites are heavily Cloudflare-protected.

### 7. Test files for HTML scrapers use subclass to limit cities
```python
class SampleGoodReturnsScraper(GoodReturnsScraper):
    CITIES = ["mumbai", "chennai", "hyderabad", "delhi", "bangalore"]
```

### 8. Test file structure
- TEST 1 — Load sources.json
- TEST 2 — Find source config block
- TEST 3 — Check API key (if applicable)
- TEST 4 — Initialise scraper
- TEST 5 — Run scraper (live call)
- TEST 6 — Check all metals/cities returned
- TEST 7+ — Source-specific validations
- Final TEST — Print full JSON output

## 🔍 What Each Built Scraper Does

### gold_api_com.py
- No auth — unlimited calls
- 4 metals: gold, silver, platinum, copper
- Symbols: XAU, XAG, XPT, HG
- One API call per metal (4 calls total per run)

### metals_dev.py
- Auth: query param — `?api_key=KEY`
- 4 metals: gold, silver, platinum, copper — ONE API call for all
- **INR exchange rate** stored in `scraper.inr_rate` — used by consolidator
- INR rate formula: `currencies.INR = 0.011` → `1 USD = 1/0.011 = ₹91`
- Copper: per pound in API → converted to troy ounce (`price_per_toz = price_per_lb / 0.0685714`)
- Gold extra{}: mcx_gold, mcx_gold_am, mcx_gold_pm, ibja_gold, lbma_gold_am, lbma_gold_pm
- Silver extra{}: mcx_silver, mcx_silver_am, mcx_silver_pm, lbma_silver
- Platinum extra{}: lbma_platinum_am, lbma_platinum_pm

### goldapi_io.py
- Auth: header — `x-access-token: KEY`
- 3 metals: gold, silver, platinum (NO copper)
- One API call per metal (3 calls total)
- **Unique: karat-wise gram prices** — no other source gives this
- Standard karats (24K, 22K, 18K) → `extra.karats{}`
- Extended karats (21K, 20K, 16K, 14K, 10K) → `extra.extended_karats{}`
- Market data: ask, bid, change, change_percent, prev_close, open, high, low

### goodreturns.py
- No auth — unlimited HTML scraping via curl_cffi (Cloudflare bypass)
- Gold only — 28 cities — one HTTP request per city
- 5 second polite delay between cities
- URL: `https://www.goodreturns.in/gold-rates/{city}.html`
- `price_usd` = None, `price_inr` = 22K price, `unit` = "gram"
- `extra.karat_prices{}` = 24K, 22K, 18K per gram INR
- Price sanity: > ₹1,000 and < ₹1,00,000 per gram

#### All 28 GoodReturns Cities
```
mumbai, delhi, chennai, hyderabad, bangalore, kolkata,
ahmedabad, pune, jaipur, lucknow, kerala, coimbatore,
madurai, visakhapatnam, vijayawada, surat, nagpur, nashik,
chandigarh, bhubaneswar, patna, vadodara, rajkot, mangalore,
mysore, salem, trichy, ayodhya
```

### consolidator/ (Phase 1 — COMPLETE)
 
**Build order and responsibility:**
 
| File | Responsibility | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| trimmed_mean.py | Consensus math — trimmed mean algorithm | None — pure math |
| anomaly_detector.py | Price range validation against metals.json | metals.json only — no scraper engine |
| validator.py | Scraper result structure validation | None |
| merger.py | Orchestrates anomaly detection + trimmed mean, builds metals dict | AnomalyDetector, TrimmedMean |
| dynamo_writer.py | Writes snapshot to DynamoDB (stub) | None |
| s3_writer.py | Writes snapshot to S3 (stub) | None |
| consolidator.py | Main pipeline orchestrator | All of the above + all scrapers |
| handler.py | Thin Lambda entry point | Consolidator |
 
**INR rate flow:**
```
MetalsDevScraper.run() → scraper.inr_rate stored on instance
→ consolidator._run_scrapers() extracts it via getattr()
→ passed explicitly to merger.merge(results, inr_rate=x)
→ merger calculates usd_to_inr = 1 / inr_rate
→ applied to all metal price_inr calculations
```
 
**GoodReturns routing:**
```
GoodReturns records (unit == "gram")
→ merger._extract_city_rates() picks them up
→ go directly into city_rates{} on the snapshot
→ NEVER enter trimmed mean calculation
→ NEVER in source_prices{}
```
 
**Karat price priority:**
```
GoldAPI.io provides karats → use directly (per gram USD)
GoldAPI.io missing/failed → calculate from purity ratios
    24K = consensus_price × 0.9999
    22K = consensus_price × 0.9166
    18K = consensus_price × 0.7500
```

---

## 🌐 html_scraper.py — Cloudflare Bypass

### Problem
GoodReturns.in is behind Cloudflare Bot Management. Standard `requests` sends a Python TLS fingerprint — blocked with 403.

### Solution
`curl_cffi` with `impersonate="chrome120"` — mimics Chrome's exact TLS handshake. Cloudflare passes it through.

### Changes
- `from curl_cffi import requests` (was `import requests`)
- `impersonate="chrome120"` added to `requests.get()`
- Added `Sec-Fetch-Dest`, `Sec-Fetch-Mode`, `Sec-Fetch-Site`, `Sec-Fetch-User` headers
- `curl_cffi==0.7.4` added to `requirements.txt`

## 📌 Key Decisions Log

| Decision | What We Chose | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | AWS Serverless Lambda | Cost effective, scales, no idle cost |
| Database | DynamoDB + S3 + Athena | No RDS needed, fully serverless |
| Primary channel | WhatsApp | 500M+ Indian users, no app needed |
| Languages | Hindi, Tamil, Telugu | Largest underserved vernacular markets |
| Repo type | Monorepo | One developer, simpler to manage |
| Infra as code | AWS SAM | Version controlled, reproducible |
| Scraping approach | API-first, scrape as fallback | APIs more reliable, less maintenance |
| Source management | Config-driven (sources.json) | Add sources without code changes |
| Failure handling | Circuit breaker pattern | Self-healing, auto-notify on failure |
| Price consensus | Trimmed mean | Drops outliers — more robust than simple average |
| Source weighting | Equal weights Phase 1 | Add reputation weighting in Phase 2 with real data |
| Confidence levels | high/medium/low/unavailable | Agent brain knows how much to trust the price |
| INR conversion | Metals.Dev only | Single source of truth for exchange rate |
| Commercial model | Free first, partnerships later | Build users before monetising |
| Code philosophy | One file one responsibility | Readable, testable, maintainable |
| Moneycontrol | Skipped | MCX data already in Metals.Dev extra{} — duplicate |
| Rapaport | Skipped | Paywalled — no public data to scrape |
| Diamond data | Deferred to Phase 2 | Core product is gold/silver for Indian families |
| Copper | Covered by gold_api_com + metals_dev | No new scraper needed |
| cities.json | Keep empty for now | City data lives in goodreturns.py CITIES + sources.json |
| Consolidator testing | Standalone script + thin Lambda wrapper | No Docker needed — same pattern as scrapers |
| HTML scraper library | curl_cffi instead of requests | Bypasses Cloudflare TLS fingerprinting |
| GoodReturns unit | "gram" not "troy_ounce" | Retail per-gram city rates — not spot |
| GoodReturns in consensus | Excluded from trimmed mean | Different unit and price type — goes to city_rates{} only |
| Raw source prices | Always stored in snapshot | Never throw data away — source_prices{} preserved |
| Spread monitoring | Calculated and stored | Large spread = signal of unusual market activity |
| Alert cooldown | 4 hours | Prevents spam when price fluctuates near threshold |
| Festival advisory | 7 days before | Enough lead time for users to plan purchases |
| Trimmed mean for 3 sources | Same trim rule as 4+ | Simpler — one consistent rule, math is identical to median |
| Validated source count | Count post-anomaly-detection only | Prevents false high confidence from rejected prices |
| Spread thresholds | <1% normal, 1-2% warn, >2% flag | Catches diverging sources without false positives |
| Claude Code | Not using — requires paid plan ($20/month Pro minimum) | Free plan has no Claude Code access. Will revisit when Phase 2 starts and iteration loops become intense enough to justify cost. |
| OpenClaw | Not using for Gold Agent development | OpenClaw is a personal assistant tool — not a dev tool. Not relevant to building Gold Agent. Claude Code is the right tool when needed. |
| VS Code + Claude | No official free integration available | Official Claude VS Code extension requires paid plan. Gemini workaround exists but Gemini is not Claude — not worth it for this project. |
| Development workflow | Claude.ai chat + manual copy to VS Code | Working well. Session by session, explain → decide → code. Better for learning and understanding every decision. |
| Consolidator build order | trimmed_mean → anomaly_detector → validator → merger → writers → consolidator → handler | Each file depends on the previous. Build small, test small, integrate at the end. |
| Consolidator test strategy | Unit tests with mock data first, end-to-end after all files done | Avoids API calls during development. Faster feedback loop. End-to-end only when all pieces are ready. |
| AnomalyDetector independence | Standalone — reads metals.json directly, no dependency on BaseScraper | Consolidator layer must not depend on scraper engine layer. Clean separation. Easier to test. No circular dependencies. |
| TrimmedMean class | Class (Option B) not standalone function | Consistent with OOP pattern used across entire project — BaseScraper, APIFetcher, HTMLScraper, DataNormaliser all classes. |
| INR rate passing to Merger | Caller passes explicitly: merger.merge(results, inr_rate=x) | Cleaner than merger extracting from results. Consolidator owns orchestration, merger owns merging. Easier to test with mock data. |
| Fixture usage | mock_goldapi_response.json used in consolidator test | Large realistic API responses stored in fixtures rather than cluttering test files with inline data. |
| mock_kitco_html.html | Deleted | Kitco dropped as source. Empty fixture referencing unused source. |
| consolidator/README.md | Deleted | Empty placeholder. Real docs live in docs/architecture/consensus-logic.md. |
| Project cleanliness | rate_limiter.py + response_parser.py kept empty | Intentional placeholders. Rate limiting in sources.json config. Response parsing in individual scrapers. |
| urllib3 warning | Ignored for now | RequestsDependencyWarning from requests library — harmless, everything works. Fix later with pip install urllib3==2.2.3 if needed. |
| GoodReturns price_usd | Always null — expected and correct | GoodReturns gives INR only. price_usd=None by design. These records go to city_rates{} not consensus. |
| AWS infrastructure tool | Terraform for infra + SAM for Lambda deploy | Terraform handles all 18+ AWS services cleanly. SAM handles Lambda packaging, zip, layers, dependencies. Industry standard split used by real teams. |
| Terraform scope | VPC, DynamoDB, S3, IAM, EventBridge, SNS, SES | Long-lived infrastructure resources that rarely change |
| SAM scope | Lambda function packaging and deployment only | SAM is simpler for Python Lambda with dependencies |
| Terraform experience | Manikanta is a beginner with Terraform | Will be guided step by step in AWS setup session |
| AWS CLI | Not yet installed on Mac | First step in AWS setup session |
| AWS setup timing | After Phase 1 local complete, before Phase 2 | Need live data pipeline before building WhatsApp bot |

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions Made in Session 9
 
### Consolidator Architecture
- Built file by file — each with its own unit test before moving to next
- AnomalyDetector is completely standalone — no scraper engine dependency
- TrimmedMean is a class — consistent with rest of project OOP pattern
- INR rate passed explicitly from consolidator to merger — not extracted inside merger
- Merger orchestrates AnomalyDetector + TrimmedMean — does not duplicate their logic
 
### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests use patch.object to mock _run_scrapers — zero live API calls
- Fixtures used for large realistic responses (GoldAPI.io)
- End-to-end test runs all live scrapers — used only after all unit tests pass
- End-to-end returned status 200 with real prices ✅
 
### Consensus Logic Finalised
- 3+ sources: always trim highest + lowest, average rest (same rule as 4+)
- Source count = validated sources after anomaly detection — not total sources run
- Spread thresholds: <1% normal, 1-2% warn, >2% flag in snapshot
- GoodReturns excluded from consensus — different unit, currency, price type
 
### Tools Decision
- Not using Claude Code (requires paid plan) — revisit at Phase 2
- Not using OpenClaw — personal assistant tool, not dev tool
- Current workflow (Claude.ai chat + manual VS Code) working well
- Will upgrade to Claude Pro ($20/month) when Phase 2 starts
 
### AWS Approach Finalised
- Terraform for infrastructure (VPC, DynamoDB, S3, IAM, EventBridge, SNS, SES)
- SAM for Lambda packaging and deployment only
- AWS CLI not yet installed — first task in AWS session
- Terraform beginner — will be guided step by step
---
 
### Next Immediate Tasks
 
**Step 1 — AWS Setup (before Phase 2)**
- Install AWS CLI on Mac
- Configure IAM credentials
- Set up Terraform for infrastructure
- Deploy core resources:
  - S3 bucket (gold-agent-prices)
  - DynamoDB tables (live_prices, source_health, quota_tracker)
  - Lambda function (gold-agent-consolidator)
  - EventBridge rule (hourly schedule)
  - IAM roles and policies
- Wire dynamo_writer.py and s3_writer.py with real boto3 calls
- Run consolidator as real Lambda — verify DynamoDB + S3 writes
 
**Step 2 — Phase 2: WhatsApp Bot**
- WhatsApp Business API setup (Meta developer console)
- agent-brain Lambda (Claude API integration)
- whatsapp-handler Lambda
- conversation Lambda
- alert-checker Lambda

# ============================================================
# ADD these rows to the Key Decisions table:
# ============================================================
 
| Trimmed mean for 3 sources | Same rule as 4+ (drop highest+lowest) | Simpler — one consistent rule, math identical to median |
| Validated source count | Count post-anomaly-detection only | Prevents false high confidence from rejected prices |
| Spread thresholds | <1% normal, 1-2% warn, >2% flag | Catches diverging sources without false positives |
| Fixtures | mock_goldapi_response.json + mock_dynamo_tables.json | Realistic test data, closer to production |
| Consolidator testing | Mock _run_scrapers with patch.object | No API calls in unit tests, fast and deterministic |
| AWS infrastructure | Terraform for infra, SAM optional for Lambda deploy | Industry standard, handles all 18+ services cleanly |
| AWS setup order | After Phase 1 local complete, before Phase 2 | Need live data pipeline before building WhatsApp bot |

### 7. Consolidator Testing Approach
 
- Written as standalone Python class — testable locally like all scrapers
- Each consolidator file built and unit tested independently with mock data
- Test order: trimmed_mean → anomaly_detector → validator → merger → writers → consolidator
- Unit tests use patch.object to mock _run_scrapers — no live API calls
- End-to-end test: python src/lambdas/consolidator/consolidator.py — makes real API calls
- Thin Lambda wrapper in handler.py — 5 lines of real logic
- All 16 unit tests passing + end-to-end returning status 200
 
### 8. AWS Infrastructure Approach
 
**Two tools, two jobs:**
 
| Tool | Job | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Terraform | All infrastructure | VPC, DynamoDB, S3, IAM, EventBridge, SNS, SES — long-lived resources |
| AWS SAM | Lambda deployment only | Simpler for Python Lambda packaging, zip, layers, dependencies |
 
This is the standard split used by real engineering teams — Terraform owns the infrastructure, SAM owns the application deployment.
 
**Terraform covers:**
- VPC + Subnets + NAT Gateway
- DynamoDB tables (live_prices, source_health, quota_tracker)
- S3 buckets (gold-agent-prices)
- IAM roles and policies
- EventBridge rules (hourly scraper schedule)
- SNS topics (developer alerts)
- SES (email alerts)
- Secrets Manager (API keys)
 
**SAM covers:**
- Lambda function packaging
- Lambda deployment
- Lambda environment variables
- Lambda timeout + memory config
 
**Setup order for AWS session:**
```
1. Install AWS CLI on Mac
2. Configure IAM credentials
3. Write Terraform modules for core resources
4. terraform init + terraform plan + terraform apply
5. Wire dynamo_writer.py with real boto3 calls
6. Wire s3_writer.py with real boto3 calls
7. Deploy consolidator Lambda via SAM
8. Set up EventBridge schedule
9. Verify end-to-end in AWS
```
 
**Important notes:**
- Manikanta is a Terraform beginner — will be guided step by step
- AWS CLI not yet installed — first thing to do in AWS session
- AWS region: ap-south-1 (Mumbai) — always
- IAM user already created under wife's root account

*Last updated: Session 9 — Phase 1 complete. All consolidator files built and tested.
End-to-end consolidator running locally with status 200. Moving to AWS setup next.*
